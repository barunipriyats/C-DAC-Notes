# Core Java- 19/5
## Features
- Simple
- Platform Independent 
- High Performance
- Java is 100% object oriented everything is in class in c++ you can write main outside classs.
- java is compiled and intrepeted language.
- JIT(Just in Time) Compilier:-
	- work just before execuation.
	- It conver some part of code directly into machine understanding.
	- because of this language become faster it avoid read and convert time.

- Security over the internet 
- Robust(strong/tough)
	- Automatic Memory Management
	- Expection Handelling
- Multithearding(multitasking)
- Distributed(Remote Server involved) 
- Dynamic

### JDK/JRE
![JDK/JRE](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/2_jdkjre.PNG) 
	
### First Program
```JAVA
	public class Hello
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			System.out.println("Hello world");
		}
	}

```

- When the class is decleared as public then the name of program should be class name..
- static method can called without object creation thats why used in main.
- `out` is the object called for print, `out` object is accessible using System class.
- `println()` is a method.
- At least one class should be public because of `main()`.
- Class name always should be start with capital.
- System=Class, out=object, println()=function.
- Setting path of java/javac(for setting epath of java and javac you need following steps.).

![setpath of java/javac](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/1_setpath.PNG)

- for run program javac _programName_.
- javac -version is used to check the version of java.
- * Bytes code(.class) always based on class name,if program name and class name is not equal then .class file name will be class name not a program name. *
	> javac _programName_ 
	> java _.classFileName_
